The Melbourne Disc Golf Club (MDGC) is a not-for-profit organisation, formed in 2008.

We believe disc golf is an enjoyable, challenging and environmentally responsible
sport that brings people together. We focus on building an inclusive community where
players of all ages and skill levels can enjoy the game.

The club runs an online "Pro Shop", which (we happen to think) is the best place to get disc golf gear in Melbourne.

A portable (car-boot) version of the Shop often makes an appearance at club [social days](/events/social),
providing a great opportunity to browse in person, and get advice on choosing discs.

Alternatively, order online beforehand and select "pickup" to collect your discs at the event.

For shop enquiries, email [proshop@melbournediscgolf.com](mailto:proshop@melbournediscgolf.com).
