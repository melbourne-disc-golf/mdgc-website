The club runs an online "Pro Shop", which (we happen to think) is the best place to get disc golf gear in Melbourne.

<Grid>

		title="MDGC Shop"
		description="buy discs and accessories"
	/>
</Grid>

A portable (car-boot) version of the Shop often makes an appearance at club [social days](/events/social),
providing a great opportunity to browse in person, and get advice on choosing discs.

Alternatively, order online beforehand and select "pickup" to collect your discs at the event.
