Keen to give it a go? Great! It's easier than you think, and you don't need much to get started.

## Where and when to play

There are [disc golf courses](/courses) dotted across Melbourne. 
They are all in public parks, and free to play. 
No need to book; just turn up any time. 
A round typically takes 45-60 minutes for 9 holes, or a couple of hours for 18.

## What you need

### Essential

- comfortable walking shoes
- at least one [_disc golf_ disc](/disc-golf#golf-discs)
  - NB: regular frisbees don't work well for disc golf
  - a "mid-range" disc is best for beginners
  - you can often [borrow discs](#borrowing-discs) from a local library
- water

### Recommended

- sun protection (hat, sunscreen)
- a small towel or cloth for cleaning your discs
- light snacks for longer rounds

### Borrowing discs

If you don't have your own disc(s), you can start by borrowing discs from a local library (for free, just like borrowing a library book).
The following libraries operate disc loan schemes:

### Objective and scoring

- It's like golf!
- A _round_ consists of a series of <span title="Yes, we call them &quot;holes&quot;, even though no actual holes are involved.">_holes_</span> (usually 9 or 18).
- Players score a _stroke_ for each throw.
- The player with the lowest score after all holes wins the round.

### Teeing off

- On the first hole: tee off in any order.  After that, the player who got the lowest score on the previous hole goes first.
- Take your first throw from the tee. Keep your feet within the tee area until you release the disc.

### Subsequent throws

- Where your disc lands is called your _lie_.
- Mark your lie with some object (traditionally, a _mini disc_), or leave the thrown disc on the ground where it landed.
- Take your next throw from (up to 30cm) behind your lie.

### Etiquette

- Don't throw if there are people in the way. We are not savages. Dogs are people too.
- The player _farthest_ from the basket throws first.
- Let faster groups play through.

### Obstacles and out-of-bounds

- Players cannot move obstacles, or otherwise alter or damage the course.
- Some courses mark areas as out-of-bounds (water, roads, etc). If your disc lands out-of-bounds:
  - Add one penalty stroke (in addition to your throw).
  - Continue play from a spot near where it went out-of-bounds.

### Completing a hole

- The hole is complete when your disc comes to rest in the basket
- The chains help catch your disc - aim for those!

## Tips

### Start simple
- Focus on accuracy and control, over power and distance.
- Learn to throw a mid-range well, before trying a driver.

- Don't be embarrassed about being a beginner.

### Be patient
- Your first round won't be perfect.
- Focus on having fun -- remember, it's just a game!
- The sport has a learning curve, but it's enjoyable at every level.
