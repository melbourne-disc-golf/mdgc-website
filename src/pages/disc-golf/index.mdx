[Disc golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf) is similar to traditional golf:
the goal is to get from a **tee** to a **target** in as few **throws** as possible.
But instead of hitting balls with clubs, you throw flying discs with your hands.

<Panel class="bg-gray-100 mx-auto max-w-2xl">
|  | traditional "ball" golf | disc golf |
|---|---|---|
| **thing** | small white **ball** | plastic flying **disc** |
| **target** | **hole** in ground | metal **basket** on a pole |
| **tools** | metal **clubs** | your bare **hands** |
| **venue** | manicured **golf course** | public **park** |
| **cost** | $$$ (clubs + green fees) | $ (discs are cheap) |
| **duration** | 4-5 hours | 2-3 hours |

The game dates back to the advent of the "[frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbee)" in the early 1960s.
The first formal disc golf course was installed in California in 1975, and
the [Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA)](https://www.pdga.com/) was formed in 1976.

The sport has grown exponentially since then, and saw major growth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
There are now over 15,000 courses worldwide. Australia got its first permanent course in the 1990s,
and Melbourne now has many excellent [courses](../courses) across the metropolitan area.

## Golf discs

<IllustrationImage src={starterSetImage} alt="RPM starter set" caption="a set of golf discs" />

Golf discs are similar to frisbees, but slightly smaller, and harder -- not designed for ease of catching.
They come in a variety of plastics, weights, and designs to cater for different situations, levels of skill, and styles of play.

At a high level, we categorize discs as:

- **drivers** - for distance off the tee
- **mid-range discs** - for controlled medium-distance shots
- **putters** - for short, accurate throws near the basket

## Baskets

<IllustrationImage src={basketImage} alt="disc golf basket" caption="disc golf basket at Bald Hill" />

The target in disc golf is a metal basket mounted on a pole, typically about chest height. The basket has chains hanging from a
central post that help "catch" the disc, slowing it down so it falls into the "cage" below.

To complete a hole, your disc must come to rest in the basket. Just hitting the chains doesn't count - it has to stay in!

## Why we love it

- **low barrier to entry** - no expensive equipment or fees
- **low ceremony** - no bookings or tee times; just turn up
- **accessible** - courses are often in public parks
- **casual atmosphere** - no dress codes, family-friendly
