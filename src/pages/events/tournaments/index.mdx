## Tournament logistics

Most events consist of **two or more 18-hole rounds**, usually played across a single day.
Some larger tournaments run over multiple days and may use more than one course, depending on format and capacity.

All tournaments require **advance registration**. Keep an eye on our website and social media for details of upcoming tournaments.

MDGC tournaments follow the [PDGA Official Rules of Disc Golf](https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf).
Players are expected to be familiar with these rules before competing.

| Pro 40+ | MP40 | FP40 |
| Amateur 1 | MA1 | FA1 |
