## About the Summer Cup Series

Some details about the series are below, but it's essentially the same format as the previous 2 years - a series is a stand-alone single-day tournaments, consisting of two PDGA rated rounds on one of our local courses. We are also very excited to have the Ruffey Rumble included in the series for the first time. Click on the events above to find out more or to register.

(Note that Ruffey Rumble is a bit different to other Summer Cup events - it is played across two days, with different divisions on both days, and has its own event prizes, Ace Pot etc. However scores from Ruffey count towards the series standings - and if you play Ruffey both days then both scores will count.)

## Prizes

### Per-event prizes

Each event will have a number of prizes on the day, typically:

- Handicap prize (highest event above PDGA rating)
- 3 or 4 CTB prizes (depending on the number of players)

These prizes will be MDGC shop vouchers.

### Ace Pot

Entry to the Ace Pot is included with your registration, with $2 added for every player. This will keep growing until someone wins, with anything left in after the final event being added to the series prize pool.

At the time or writing, going into the Hot Start the Ace Pot is at $160.

### Series Prize Pool

All fees remaining after event costs (PDGA / ADG fees, shop costs etc.) will go into the series prize pool. This will be divided up among the top players in each prize division - see below for more information about series standings and divisions. Series prizes will also be in MDGC shop vouchers.
