## About the Summer Cup Series

The Summer Cup is a series is a stand-alone single-day\* tournaments, consisting of two PDGA rated rounds on one of our local courses - although this year for the first time we are taking the show on the road with one event on the new course in Churchill. We are also very excited to have Ruffey Rumble included in the series for the first time.

The events are low-cost, social, and a great way for newer players to play their first tournament. Play as many or as few as you want, with your best 3 scores counting towards your overall series standing.

## Prizes

### Per-event prizes

- Handicap prize (whoever played most above their rating)
- CTB prizes (grouped by division)

### Series points and prizes

- End-of-series prizes for top performers in each division (smaller divisions may be combined)
- Ace pot runs across the series - any aces split the pot

Play as many or as few events as you want.
Your "series rating" will be calculated by summing your PDGA event-ratings for your best 3 events.

Standings are organised by division, but you can choose which division you want to be recorded in per event.
