## About the Summer Cup Series

Some details about the series are below, but it's essentially the same format as the previous 2 years - a series is a stand-alone single-day tournaments, consisting of two PDGA rated rounds on one of our local courses. We are also very excited to have the Ruffey Rumble included in the series for the first time. Click on the events above to find out more or to register.

(Note that Ruffey Rumble is a bit different to other Summer Cup events - it is played across two days, with different divisions on both days, and has its own event prizes, Ace Pot etc. However scores from Ruffey count towards the series standings - and if you play Ruffey both days then both scores will count.)

## Prizes

### Per-event prizes

Each event will have a number of prizes on the day, typically:

- Handicap prize (highest event above PDGA rating)
- 3 or 4 CTB prizes (depending on the number of players)

These prizes will be MDGC shop vouchers. Note that there are no payouts for pro divisions in Summer Cup events.

### Ace Pot

Entry to the Ace Pot is included with your registration, with $2 added for every player. This will keep growing until someone wins, with anything left in after the final event being added to the series prize pool.

### Series Prize Pool

All fees remaining after event costs (PDGA / ADG fees, shop costs etc.) and prizes will go into the series prize pool. This will be divided up among the top players in each prize division - see below for more information about series standings and divisions. Series prizes will also be in MDGC shop vouchers.

## Divisions and Standings

### Series Divisions

At every event you play, you earn points equal to your PDGA event rating. Your best 3 rated events count towards your overall score. The series uses the same divisions as standard ADG events, from MPO.

Note that you don't have to play the same division in every event - we appreciate that sometimes people want to play different divisions for more competition / social reasons. For this reason, we will count your scores in your usual division for the Summer Cup series standings. e.g. if you play two events in MA2 and one in MA1 then we will count all your scores towards the MA2 standings.

### Series Standings

Current standings will be published after the second event, and updated after each one.

You can find last year's standings here for reference: [2024/25 Series results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x3mc_HrhEgx4hkahhBVCuDq3yAhh85W8BExwmBePm0s/edit?usp=sharing)

### Prize Divisions

Since there will many divisions, some with lots of players and some with very few, we will consolidate similarly ranked divisions into "Prize Divisions" for the purposes of series payouts. e.g. last year, MA2 was very small, so it was combined with MA1 for series prize pool purposes. Details will be confirmed once the numbers are clearer.
