The Melbourne Disc Golf Club hosts various tournaments throughout the year. They're a great way to test your skills, and meet other players.

Our members also compete in tournaments elsewhere in Victoria, around Australia, and even overseas.

## Tournament logistics

All tournaments require **advance registration**.

Most events consist of **two or more 18-hole rounds**.
Some are over in a single day, while others are spread over multiple days, and may involve rounds at more than one course.

MDGC tournaments follow the [PDGA Official Rules of Disc Golf](https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf) --
players are expected to be familiar with these rules before competing.

## Divisions

Players are classified into (and compete within) [divisions](https://www.pdga.com/divisions/), e.g.

| Level | Mixed | Female |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Pro Open | MPO | FPO |
| Pro 40+ | MP40 | FP40 |
| Amateur 1 | MA1 | FA1 |
| Amateur 2 | MA2 | FA2 |
| Amateur 3 | MA3 | FA3 |
| Amateur 4 | MA4 | FA4 |
| Amateur 40+ | MA40 | FA40 |
| Amateur 50+ | MA50 | FA50 |
| Junior (under 15) | MJ15 | FJ15 |

Don't worry if you're new to competitive disc golf -- most of us are amateurs, and we welcome new players!
