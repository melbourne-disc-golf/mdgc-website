## What

Social Days are the mainstay of the MDGC calendar, where most new players get their first experience of organised events.
We aim to make Social Days welcoming and friendly -- a great place for new players to come and learn the rules and
pick up tips from more experienced players.

A Social Day involves playing a round of 18 holes, which generally takes about 2½ hours.
We typically get 30–60 players at each one, ranging from beginners to professionals, young (kids) to old (die-hards).

We play in groups of (up to) four players.
Event organisers will assign players to semi-random groups, mixing skill levels to help new players learn.
If you have a friend you'd like to play with, mention it when you sign up, and we'll do our best to make it happen.


## When and where

We split the year into two seasons (Feb-Jun and Jul-Nov), with 15 Social Days in each season.
We alternate between Saturdays and Sundays, and rotate around three "zones":

- **West Melbourne** - 1st weekend of month
- **South East Melbourne** - 2nd weekend of month
- **North East Melbourne** - 3rd weekend of month

<NextSocialDay />

We usually have an early round starting at 8:00am, and a later one at 10:30am -- you can choose which time suits you best when you register.

## Registering

Social Days are free for club [members](/club/membership). Casual players are welcome too -- first time is free, $12 per round after that.

<div class="callout">
**Pre-registration is required** for all Social Days.
</div>

We use [Disc Golf Metrix](https://discgolfmetrix.com/?u=club_events&id=235) (aka "Metrix") to manage registration.
Registration closes on the evening before the event.
Once you've found an upcoming event you're interested in, click on the <span class="metrix-button">Register here</span> button on the top right to sign up.

You'll need an [Australian Disc Golf](https://www.australiandiscgolf.com/) number, for insurance purposes (but it's free and easy to [join](https://www.australiandiscgolf.com/join/)).

## Scoring

We also use Metrix to keep scores on the day.
Each group will have at least one experienced player who can help with scoring and using the app.
We prefer to have 2 people scoring on each card for accuracy.

Start scoring for your group by pressing <span class="metrix-button">Enter</span>, then <span class="metrix-button">Start...</span>.
More details on scoring are available [here](https://discgolfmetrix.com/?u=rule&ID=6).

## Divisions and ratings

Once you've played three rounds, Metrix will calculate your rating based on your scores.
Your rating will continue to be automatically adjusted after every round you play.

Social Days have 5 different divisions, based on your Metrix rating and whether you are a club member:

- **Div A** - Members rated over 890
- **Div B** - Members rated from 815 to 890
- **Div C** - Members rated below 815
- **Div X** - Members who don't have a rating yet
- **Div Z** - Non-members (any rating)

## Prizes

At every Social Day, there are 6 prizes up for grabs, each of which is a $25 voucher for the MDGC shop
where you can use them to buy discs, pay for entry to club events etc. These prizes are:

- 3 × handicap prizes - one each for Div A, B and C
- 3 × CTB (closest to the basket) prizes - one each for Div A, B and C (Div X and Z players are also eligible for the Div C CTB)

There is an optional **Ace Club** that pays out a cash prize to members who get an ace (hole-in-one) at a Social Day.
Ace Club membership costs $30 and covers you for the calendar year. The pot is topped up at each event, to a maximum of $500. If multiple players ace on the same day, they share the pot.

There is also a **leaderboard** for each season -- a combined ladder for all divisions.
Prizes are awarded to top finishers, as well as to the top female players.
To qualify for these prizes, you must be a MDGC member, and play 5 or more rounds.

## Club Champs

We run a Club Championship tournament at the end of each year.
It typically involves two rounds, and two different Melbourne courses.

To complete in the Champs, Players must qualify by playing at Social Days, and performing well in their division.
