<Text>

While disc golf _can_ be enjoyed solo, the best way to experience the sport is to play with others.

MDGC events bring together players of all skill levels to share the joy of disc golf in a
supportive and welcoming community.

## Google Calendar (old)

We previously used a Google Calendar to track events. We're now managing events directly on the website, but the old calendar is shown below for reference.

<Calendar
