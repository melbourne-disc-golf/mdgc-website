<Text>

The **MDGC Summer Cup** is a series of 4-6 events across December and January. These are low-cost, no-frills, fun events for those who want to play some PDGA tournaments on local Melbourne courses.

## Events

<EventCalendar events={calendarEvents} maxDaysInPast={7} maxDaysInFuture={60} />

## Prizes

### Per-event prizes

- Handicap prize (whoever played most above their rating)
- CTB prizes (grouped by division)

### Series points and prizes

- End-of-series prizes for top performers in each division (smaller divisions may be combined)
- Ace pot runs across the series - any aces split the pot

Play as many or as few events as you want. 
Your "series rating" will be calculated by summing your PDGA event-ratings for your best 3 events.

Standings are organised by division, but you can choose which division you want to be recorded in per event.
