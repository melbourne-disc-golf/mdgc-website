Who wants to wear the crown?

The 2025 Club Championships will be held on **14 December** - a morning round at [Bald Hill](/courses/bald-hill), an afternoon round at [Bicentennial Park](/courses/bicentennial). Lowest combined score wins.

## Divisions

- **Division A** - experienced players
- **Division B** - intermediate players
- **Division C** - newer players
- **Women's**
- **Age 50+**

Your Disc Golf Metrix rating at the time of the Championship determines your division. If you qualify for more than one division, you choose which to play in.

## How to qualify

1. [Register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IG_0L0F3yi2j14TpqbWb4u4K7VcdQ3p6RT6L0onVhn4) with your details and chosen division
2. Submit your **best rated [Social Day](/events/social) round from 2025**.

The highest rated scores in each division will qualify. This is a change from previous years, when we required your 3 best submissions from 3 different courses. Now you just need one good round!

Once registered, you'll be added to the qualification list. We'll send periodic updates on where the divisions stand.
If you improve on your submitted round later in the year, email [mdgcclubchamps@gmail.com](mailto:mdgcclubchamps@gmail.com) and we'll update your entry.

Field size per division will depend on interest - likely 4-10 players per division.
