This will be the first ever tournament held at the brand new [Mathison Park](/courses/mathison-park) course (opened in November 2025).

We're hoping that Melbourne players will make the drive east to support this new course, and that a few locals might join the fun as well.

This event is part of the [MDGC Summer Cup](/events/summer-cup) series.
