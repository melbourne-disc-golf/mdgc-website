[Mathison Park](/courses/mathison-park) is a brand new course that was only opened in November 2025. This will be the first ever tournament held there - we're hoping Melbourne players will make the drive east to support this new course and that a few locals might join the fun as well.

Part of the **MDGC Summer Cup** series.

## Logistics

This will be a 1 day / 2 round PDGA tournament. Schedules will be published closer to the date.
