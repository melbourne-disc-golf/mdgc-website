For the 3rd year running MDGC will host a pop-up event at the Olinda Precinct (old Olinda Golf Course).  This course has some iconic downhill holes, some touchy postage stamp greens with roll away potential in an amazing place with great mountain views.   It is also a test of stamina/fitness!!

For this years event we are planning to move to March timing to take advantage of longer daylight hours and are looking to add a 10th basket to increase capacity to 50 (still will have 5 person groups).

This is a tough/steep course with some pretty thick rough off the fairway, so please come prepared for a serious walk, wear long pants and there is potential for lost discs.

Registration is planned to open on Jan 26th at 6pm via the club shop event rego page.
