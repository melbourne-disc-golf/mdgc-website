Mathison Park is a brand new course that opened in November 2025, located in Churchill in the Latrobe Valley (Gippsland).

The course was developed in direct response to community feedback gathered during a 2022 co-design session with Kurnai College, where increasing recreational opportunities in Churchill was identified as a key priority. The course is also thanks to VicHealth through Council’s VicHealth Local Government partnership.

The 18-hole course begins at Mathison Park and is one of only a few full courses of its kind in regional Victoria.
