The club first played at **Llewellyn Park** for our "Melbourne Celebrates 2023" event, with a temporary 18-hole course set up around the park.
It's now became a regular fixture on our Social Days circuit.

## Features

- 18 holes (18 tees, 9 baskets)

## Facilities

- toilets (open 7am-7pm daily on timer)
- water fountain
- free BBQ facilities

## Getting there

### By public transport

- **Bus** (routes **737** or **757**)

### By car

- If the gates are open (e.g. on Social Days), parking is available beside the main pavilion.
- Otherwise, park in Llewellyn Park Drive, Helpmann Street, Coppelia Street, or Blind Creek Lane.

## Safety and other considerations

The course is maintained by Knox City Council. It can get a bit slushy during winter but in the dryer months, when freshly mown, you would think it were a manicured traditional golf course!

The course is shared with the Eastside Drone Club that sets up either at the west or north of the main pavilion. The new holes have been reconfigured to avoid their setup, but please be respectful when they operate from the pavilion.

Users of other sporting facilities have the right of way. If the ovals are in use, please adjust your approach to the basket/s so that you do not encroach on the field of play.
<u>Never</u> throw if there is any chance you could hit someone else in the park or on the sporting fields.
