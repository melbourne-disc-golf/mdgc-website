Designed and installed by MDGC in conjunction with Melton City Council, this course
showcases the natural beauty of **Little Blind Creek Reserve**, giving disc golfers of all levels a challenge.

The starts with a signature "island" hole running alongside a high-traffic road, allowing all locals to gaze at the wonder that is disc golf. Holes are short and technical with multiple lines allowing for both sidearm and backhand on most holes.
Birdies feel achievable if you get past the gumtrees in some rather inconvenient spots. Pros beware: hole 8 may just crush your dreams of a perfect 9!

A check-in QR code is located on the sign at the first tee -- please check in, so we can demonstrate course usage with the Melton City Council, and help grow our sport.
