**Ruffey Lake Park** is an amazingly large area of public parkland in the heart of the eastern suburbs.
This is MDGC's  "home turf" -- the site of the first permanent disc golf course in Melbourne.

## Features

- 18 holes (9 tees, 18 baskets)

## Facilities

- toilet
- water fountain
- playground
- BBQ facilities

## History

We started playing regular informal rounds at "Ruffey" in 2008, using temporary baskets and makeshift tees.

In 2012, Manningham City Council installed a permanent 6 basket course. In 2016, they added 3 more baskets, along with a second set of tees, to create an 18-hole course.

The course was re-configured and upgraded (new baskets and concrete tees) in 2023.

## Getting there

### By car

- Carpark is at the end of Church Road (off King St).
- The carpark can be busy on weekends as it's a popular picnic spot.

### By public transport

- **Bus** (routes **279**, **908**, **295**, **318**)
  - Note that Ruffey Lake Park is quite large, so be sure to check walking directions from your bus stop to the course before departing.
