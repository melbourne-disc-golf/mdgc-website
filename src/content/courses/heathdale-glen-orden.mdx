The Melbourne Disc Golf Club and Wyndham City are working together to provide a course at the Heathdale Glen Orden Reserve in Werribee.

It's a nine basket course separated into "north" and "south" sections.
After finishing hole five in the north section, use the path running the northeast section of the reserve to get to hole six.

## Features

- 18 holes (9 tees, 18 baskets)

## Facilities

- water (near BMX track)

## Getting there

### By car

- Nearest parking is located at the [Glen Orden Sports Club](https://goo.gl/maps/76Q9aCnYfSr4Nnwc8).

### By public transport

- **Bus** (routes **161** and **170**)

## Environmental considerations

MDGC and Wyndham City designed the course to avoid sensitive areas in the reserve.
The course is located away from the actual Heathdale Glen Orden Wetlands area.
A preliminary environment assessment of the space was conducted and it was found to be a suitable area for disc golf.
The space will continue to be monitored throughout the trial period.

We do ask, however, that anyone playing the course take note of any concerns they have for wildlife or the general surrounding environment. It’s also imperative that disc golfers respect the park and the wildlife that lives there.
