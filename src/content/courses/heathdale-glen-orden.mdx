The Melbourne Disc Golf Club and Wyndham City are working together to provide a course at the Heathdale Glen Orden Reserve in Werribee.

The trial course was redesigned at the end of 2025 with a new starting location near the AquaPulse swimming facility and parking and features three different layouts to suit all levels of player — a quick beginner 5-hole loop, and 10-hole intermediate and advanced loops. The course starts at the north end of the reserve on Derrimut Road, close to the AquaPulse parking.

The beginner (red) 5-hole loop layout uses the eastern section of the reserve adjacent to Derrimut Road and opposite AquaPulse. The intermediate and advanced 10-hole layouts extend the eastern section and use the central triangle of the reserve with baskets and holes now placed on the connecting sections as you walk between.

During the trial where signage is limited and only the front of the tee pads are marked, [UDisc](https://udisc.com/courses/heathdale-glen-orden-trial-course-r4D1) is best used to locate the tee, baskets and the next hole locations. UDisc usage stats will also be used to monitor usage of the course and help us establish a permanent course in the reserve, so be sure to record your rounds using UDisc.

## Environmental considerations

MDGC and Wyndham City designed the course to avoid sensitive areas in the reserve.
The course is located away from the actual Heathdale Glen Orden Wetlands area.
A preliminary environment assessment of the space was conducted and it was found to be a suitable area for disc golf.
The space will continue to be monitored throughout the trial period.

We do ask, however, that anyone playing the course take note of any concerns they have for wildlife or the general surrounding environment. It’s also imperative that disc golfers respect the park and the wildlife that lives there.
