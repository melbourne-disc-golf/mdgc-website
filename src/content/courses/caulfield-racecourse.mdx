## Getting there

### By car

- From the roundabout, proceed east on the extension of Glen Eira Rd, through the open gates, into the main tunnel.
- Parking is available beside the amenities building.

### By public transport

- **Train** (**Caulfield** Station)
- **Tram** (route **3**)
- **Bus** (Routes **623** and **624**)

## Safety and other considerations

The course is well maintained (by the Caulfield Racecourse Trust).
Due to its sandy base it remains in great condition even after significant rain.

Please respect all fixed fencing that is close to the course and in some cases defines out of bounds.

Users of _other_ sporting facility <u>always</u> have the right of way.
If there is a cricket or football game on the main oval, adjust your approach to the basket/s so that you do not encroach on the field of play.

<u>Never</u> throw if there is any chance you could hit someone else in the park or on the sporting fields.
