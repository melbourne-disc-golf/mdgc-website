I live in Eltham with my wife Sonia and our daughter Alexandra, 2 dogs, 2 cats and hundreds of birds that want to be fed daily. By day I am a Civil Engineer with the title Technical Director Civil, which basically means I’ve seen a fair bit over the last 35 years and have grey hair so ask me any question if you are stuck. I’m fairly handy after completing 3 full home renovations and have a hobby of making wood fired ovens.

I grew up in Templestowe at the confluence of Ruffey Creek and the Yarra River, pre installation of the Ruffey Lake Disc Golf Course. Subsequently I have taken up disc golf late which is a minor regret as I have always enjoyed throwing sports like baseball or just skimming stones on the Yarra River and my dog and I actually found disc golf when going for a walk at Ruffey.

I decided to join the MDGC board as disc golf is such a welcoming community and I want to put something back into the community and the sport. Being a civil engineer I enjoy course design and the 3D visualisation of what can be done with outdoor spaces and combining that the weird and wonderful constraints of a flying disc. As my disc collection expands rapidly I am looking forward to helping disc golf grow as a healthy sport across Melbourne and it’s outer reaches.
